# Can Hip-Hop Artists use their Digital Profiles to have a Positive Effect on Existential Risks?
## How can you interract with the internet?
When you interract with the internet you will have a digital identity. Your digital identity can be organised into personal, instititional/professional, vistor, and resisdant. However your digital identity on a particular website does not necessarily have to be exclusive to one of these. A good way of visualising your digital identities is through a Virtual Residence Map, as shown below





For this project I have made a short YouTube video linking musical artists digital profiles to existential risks, and if they can use their digital profiles to have a positive effect on existential risks. In this project I also delve into specific songs by hip-hop artists and how through their art they try to tackle existential risks such as systematic racism, and racism as a whole.
