# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template (2022)
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the template for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) assignment in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.

## Portfolio items
The portfolio contains:

1. **website** exploring the theme given with a short video documentary.
2. **self-assessment** using the marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file. Unfortunately I did not get the chance to peer assess or have my work peer assessed as I was late joining the class due to a family emergency, however I have managed to explain my ideas for my project and received advice on how it should be completed. I have done the same for others in the class.
3. **portfolio overview** providing a succinct overview of your portfolio, an outline of completed tasks (Log) in this `README.md` file.
